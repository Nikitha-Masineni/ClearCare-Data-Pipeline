# ClearCare Data Pipeline â€“ Healthcare ETL Project

This project is a group effort aimed at cleaning and enriching healthcare data from JSON sources. The pipeline was built using Python scripts to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data, primarily for hospital and insurance-related datasets.

## Project Overview

The pipeline handles batch processing of raw JSON files, parses nested structures, cleans inconsistencies, and prepares enriched outputs ready for analytics or storage.

## My Contribution

I contributed to:
- Data cleaning and preparation before ingestion
- Handling messy or invalid JSON inputs across batches
- Assisting in testing and validating output data for correctness
- Reviewing script logic, documenting structure, and coordinating dataset flow

## Tech Stack
- Python (scripts by teammates)
- JSON parsing
- Data cleaning (manual + structured prep)
- ETL workflow understanding
- GitHub for collaboration

## How to Run (for developers)
1. Set up a Python environment
2. Use `config.yaml` to configure file paths
3. Run `ETL_pipeline.py` to start the process
4. Processed output files will be saved as defined in the configuration
